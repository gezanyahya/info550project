## My project

For my project, I will analyze Women's Tennis Association (WTA) data. 

To analyze the data you will need to install some `R` packages. To install the required packages, from the project folder you can run

```bash
make install
```



## Execute the analysis

To execute the analysis, from the project folder you can run 

```bash
make report.html
```

This will create a file called `report.html` output in your directory that contains the results.
